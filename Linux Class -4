CP COMMAND: <cp source destination>

cp command is used to copy the files or data from one place to another place
ex: cp file1 file2


By the above command, the data from file1 copies into file2. But the problem is it will overwrite the data which are present in file2.

To overcome this issue we will use cat command.

cat source_file (file1) >> destination_file (file2)
